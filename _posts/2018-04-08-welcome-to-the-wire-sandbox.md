Hi there! Welcome to the WI+RE sandbox! This is our place to play around and experiment with web publishing. We can explore all kinds of things here - coding, editing, html, css, ruby, web animations - you name it!

We may also use this space to do more process oriented posts and share some of our prototypes - we'll see!

For now, let's use this as an opportunity to talk about how posts work.

You'll find the code for this post in the `_posts` directory. Take a look at the code repository at [https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox) and see if you can find the code for this post.

The code for this post is written in something called markdown, which is kind of like a simplified version of html. We use both markdown and html (and some ruby) in our posts.

Here's a quick [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get you started.

#### Ready for a challenge?

1. Make a fork of the [wire-sandbox repository](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox).
2. In your fork, find the `_posts` directory
3. Edit this post - it is called `2018-04-08-welcome-to-the-wire-sandbox.md`
4. Add a quote you like to the section below! Check out the previous examples to see how the formatting works! Also add yourself to the list of authors in the metadata at the top of the page.
5. Check out your change! It should be posted to the version of the site that is now hosted on your github pages account. The url should look something like this: `https://yourgithubusername.github.io/wire-sandbox/` - did it work? If not, find someone to help troubleshoot!
6. Like your changes? Create a pull request to get your changes added back in to the sandbox site! After you make your pull request, you'll need to find Shannon, Taylor, or Doug to merge your changes into the sandbox.
