We're thrilled to host our very first design jam!

Design jams give us the chance to share ideas and prototypes in progress with the WI+RE community and get essential feedback on our work. Today we organized our jam session around 3 design challenges from our current projects. For each, we set up a table and facilitated a quick, 15-minute activity to gather insights and inform our next steps. Participants got to visit each table to provide their ideas, feedback, and advice.

## Design Challenge Tables

<!-- would these be better as cards? maybe tabbed cards? https://materializecss.com/cards.html -->


<!-- card 1 -->
 <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
    <span class="card-title">❶ Reading strategies</span>
      <p>What are the top challenges with academic reading? What are your favorite reading strategies? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To address these challenges, we're currently gathering ideas and storyboarding. Our initial approach is to explore creating a series of very short (1 minute or less) personal narratives that introduce a wide variety of reading strategies. Our hope for this project is that we'll be able to help learners think about and expand their reading toolbox.</p>

            <p>At this table we expanded on a few conversations we have been having on <a href="https://twitter.com/WIREbruin/status/984915720801632257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">social media</a> to gather ideas and advice on quick academic reading tips we can share with students. We also shared a few storyboards in progress, and asked for feedback using one of our favorite feedback activities: "I like, I wish, What if?" or IL/IW/WI.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In an IL/IW/WI activity, participants provide feedback, starting their sentences with "I like..." "I wish..." or "What if...?" in order to share feedback that is both helpful and specific.</p>

### Wrap-up chat:

To wrap things up, we had did some whole group brainstorming and generated some great ideas for potential future projects and events:

#### What are your ideas for new design challenges?

<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>What do I do with feedback from my instructors? How to interpret and use instructor feedback?</li>
    <li>Proposal writing.</li>
    <li>Advocating for your work and ideas.</li>
    <li>Imposter syndrome.</li>
</ul>


#### What feedback do you have on this meeting? IL/IW/WI?

##### I like

<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>Open format, can join any time</li>
    <li>Creative conversations and idea sharing.</li>
    <li>Bringing together instructors, students, and staff to talk about learning challenges.</li>
</ul>

##### What if?

<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>What if there were a WI+RE roadshow, where we take design challenges to various campus groups to get feedback during their scheduled meeting times?<li>
    <li>What if there were puppies? And cookies? at the meetings?.</li>
    <li>What if we partnered with the Cross-Campus Teaching Innovations Group? Maybe hosting a quick roadshow at one of their meetings?</li>
    <li>What if we offered drop-in hours as part of our regular work - i.e., drop-in and provide feedback when you have time.</li>
    <li>What if we invited students to share their challenges with us somehow within the library? e.g., a "feeling stuck?" pop-up.</li>
</ul>
