We're thrilled to host our very first design jam!

Design jams give us the chance to share ideas and prototypes in progress with the WI+RE community and get essential feedback on our work. Today we organized our jam session around 3 design challenges from our current projects. For each, we set up a table and facilitated a quick, 15-minute activity to gather insights and inform our next steps. Participants got to visit each table to provide their ideas, feedback, and advice.

## Design Challenge Tables

<!-- would these be better as cards? maybe tabbed cards? https://materializecss.com/cards.html -->


<!-- card 1 -->
 <div class="card">
    <div class="card-content">
    <span class="card-title">❶ Reading strategies</span>
      <p>What are the top challenges with academic reading? What are your favorite reading strategies? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To address these challenges, we're currently gathering ideas and storyboarding. Our initial approach is to explore creating a series of very short (1 minute or less) personal narratives that introduce a wide variety of reading strategies. Our hope for this project is that we'll be able to help learners think about and expand their reading toolbox.</p>

            <p>At this table we expanded on a few conversations we have been having on <a href="https://twitter.com/WIREbruin/status/984915720801632257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">social media</a> to gather ideas and advice on quick academic reading tips we can share with students. We also shared a few storyboards in progress, and asked for feedback using one of our favorite feedback activities: "I like, I wish, What if?" or IL/IW/WI.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In an IL/IW/WI activity, participants provide feedback, starting their sentences with "I like..." "I wish..." or "What if...?" in order to share feedback that is both helpful and specific.</p>

      <div id="ideas4"><ul class="browser-default"><li>Overall, the feedback was widely supportive of our visuals. The bruin bear is a crowd pleaser. The revamped flashlight section was also brought up by multiple people as being their favorite part! The pie chart design is also effective. We got some good feedback on our script, as well!</li>
      <li>One small thing that is yet unresolved is how much spinning is too much spinning. There were as many proponents of the spinning as there were people cautious about it… perhaps just a little less spinning might be recommended (e.g. the “Your current research” text in the center toward the start of the video)</li></ul>

<p><b>A few wishes/what if’s included:</b></p>
    <ul class="browser-default">
     <li>Adding a glossary for terms (e.g. “academia,” “primary source)—this may be best implemented in the interactive module part of the tutorial. We were imagining something that you could hover over, perhaps…</li></ul>
     <li>Emphasizing a few more things:
        <ul><li>That your “research question” is a malleable, changing thing; it isn’t static, and your thesis will grow and change as you expand your perspectives</li>
        <li>To refer back to the prompt & bring drafts, questions, etc. to the InqLab 
Pointing students toward our other materials (once they have these resources, what do they do with them? Direct them to other things we’ve made)</li></ul></li>
     <li>The “Other Disciplines” section—perhaps instead of having the bear move from building to building, the buildings could be highlighted/grow bigger/etc as the corresponding audio refers to them (if it says psychology, the building that represents “psychology” is lit up, etc.)</li>
</p></div>

### Wrap-up chat:

To wrap things up, we asked:

1. What were the highlights at your tables? Insights? Unknowns?
2. What are your ideas for new design challenges?
   *What to do with feedback?
   *advocating for your work
   *imposter syndrome
3. What feedback do you have on this meeting?
   *Could we do a version of this "on the road" at other departmental meetings
   *CCTIG - contact Erin
   *Drop-in times at WI+RE
   *give earlier notice of design jam
   *send materials out for people who like to process before hand
